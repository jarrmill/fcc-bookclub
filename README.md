Please note two things:
  1. As this is hosted on a free Heroku node, it can take up to 30 seconds to load.
  2. After several monthes of activity, it appears that there is an issue with the book images loading... I will try and look      into this if I have spare time, although there are higher priorities right now. Loading a book with a new image works as      intended. JM 10.06.18 

Thanks!
